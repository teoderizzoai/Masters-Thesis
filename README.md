## 📘 Overview

This thesis explores how epigenetic processes contribute to the development and persistence of epilepsy, and presents a simulation-based model using **higher-order multi-adaptive neural networks**. The model demonstrates how **DNA methylation**, **histone modifications**, and **microRNA regulation** can shift brain circuits into a chronic seizure-prone state under prolonged stress.

## 🧪 What I Did

- Developed a **fifth-order adaptive self-modeling neural network** using the network reification framework from Treur (2020)
- Modeled interactions among key molecular actors: **BDNF**, **LIMK1**, **miR-132**, and **miR-134**
- Simulated epileptogenesis under chronic stress and explored the system's dynamics over time
- Designed and tested an **epigenetic therapy simulation** aimed at reversing maladaptive methylation and acetylation
- Visualized multi-level feedback loops in MATLAB and generated role matrices to define network functions

## 🧬 Key Contributions

- Integrated biological realism with formal neural network modeling
- Captured the layered adaptivity of gene expression and its regulation by environmental stress
- Demonstrated how **epigenetic interventions** can restore network stability and reduce seizure susceptibility

## 📊 Results Summary

### Simulation 1 – Stress-Induced Epileptogenesis
- Persistent stress increased sensor and excitability activity
- Network transitioned to a **chronic hyperexcitable state**
- Adaptive regulatory mechanisms failed to reverse seizure activity

### Simulation 2 – Epigenetic Therapy
- Introduced targeted intervention via a therapy node
- **W- and T-state recovery** showed significant reversal of hyperexcitability
- Seizure activity reduced to near-baseline levels post-intervention
